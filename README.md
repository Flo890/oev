# OEV
is a small Java UI tool to make Lightpainting photos and videos of a timelapse photo sequence.
You can find a description with samples of its use cases here: http://tf-fotovideo.de/oev/

The code is from 2013 so its pretty old and contains lots of crap; but unfortunately I don't have time to work on improving OEV. So maybe someone else likes and wants to improve it
